## Experience Creating a Browser Extension

Working in a team, we all had to find a way to communicate while we were not in class in order to work on the extension. Since we really only had one class session to work on the initial conception of the idea, we had to implement it in our own time and work around everyone's schedules or just assign a person to a specific feature. It can be hard sometimes because people like me, don't get inspiration or drive to work on a project until what can seem like the last minute, and having to push through that to work with my team to create a product, helps me realize it's okay to not have it all done or together in time, as long as you know what you're going for you can make a plan to get to the end. I believe that the UI design I made helps with the idea of having a plan because we can focus on the MVP (minimum viable product) that we thought of on the day we started the project.
