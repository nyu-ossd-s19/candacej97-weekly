## Kevin Fleming Talk

I found two things interesting about things that Kevin Fleming spoke about in class. The first thing I found interesting was that Bloomberg had an outage in their terminal systems on April 17, 2015 which caused financial turmoil in the UK. I also found it surprising that they allow their employees and interns to contribute to open source projects and make sure that features get pulled back upstream so that it gives back to the community.

## Team Project - Personal Progress

I've done documentation and submitting pull request. We're hoping to create another challenge to submit next week.
