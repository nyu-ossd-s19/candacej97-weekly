## Christos Bacharakis from Mozilla Presentation

I liked that Mozilla is really pushing for open source to become more of a standard. A couple of their projects jumped out at me: Project Things and Firefox Listen. Project Things really interested me because I've always seen smart homes as a limited option of security and connectivity. For example, you find a outdoor camera system that you like, however, there is no option for a stationary indoor monitor. This limitation can possibly be fixed with the help of this project to tap into the IP of the camera to have a mounted tablet that is used as a monitor for the camera 24/7. Firefox Listen is convenient when you want to go back to a specific place in a podcast or article to share it with friends or for other references.

## Experience of Installing Materialize

Since the software is really a CSS Framework, the installation was quite simple for me. All I had to do was follow the download instructions that was located in the README.md file.
