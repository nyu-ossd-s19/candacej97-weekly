##Open Source

When I hear "open source" I think about software that I am able to tinker with. If I want to add functionality and features to it, I should be able to and if I want to disable somethings I should be able to do that too. The freedom to change code without restrictions and the possibility for innovation are advantages of open source. On the other hand, closed source software has a higher level of customer support with usable, reliable, and more secure code. Some potential problems with open source code lay in the reasons closed source code was widespread in the first place. How can developers working on open source projects monetize their work? How can the users be sure that the developers will continue to keep the software updated? These questions and more are things that run through my mind, and others' when thinking about contributing to or starting open projects. 

I chose to register for this course because open source seems to be a movement that huge companies are acknowledging. I want to learn more about GitHub, Mozilla and other companies involved in this community and how to correctly release a product/project that is free and open for others to contribute to.

##Projects

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) is a code editor that incorporates development tools like a debugger and gives its users/developers the opportunity to add to the community by creating extensions that could be useful to others like GitHub integration. I used to use Sublime Text, [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom), IDLE and Eclipse, but VS Code makes it easier for me to jump right into my work. I am able to write in multiple different languages and run code directly from the software so I was able to let go of Eclipse and IDLE.
2. [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) is a Javascript library made for building UI based on components. I began using React in the Summer of 2018. Before React, I used vanilla Javascript (not even ES6). React showed me _how_ it was possible to refresh different parts of a page without refreshing the whole page, updating content without moving to another page and how choppy the execution of my sites were versus how fluid they can be. Some possible alternatives are vanilla JS, [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) or [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).
3. [HandlebarsJS](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js) is a templating engine that I use alongside my simple Express applications. [Marko](https://github.com/marko-js/marko) and [Mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) are alternatives to Handlebars. I use handlebars because it's what I was exposed to in my Applied Internet Technology course and I like the flexibility to create functions as "helpers" whenever I need more robust templating than the stock functions and commands.
