##Open Source

When I hear "open source" I think about software that I am able to tinker with. If I want to add functionality and features to it, I should be able to and if I want to disable somethings I should be able to do that too. The freedom to change code without restrictions and the possiblity for innovation are advantages of open source. On the other hand, closed source software has a higher level of customer support with usable, reliable, and more secure code. Some potential problems with open source code lay in the reasons closed source code was widespread in the first place. How can devlopers working on open source projects monetize their work? How can the users be sure that the developers will continue to keep the software updated? These questions and more are things that run through my mind, and others' when thinking about contributing to or starting open projects. 

I chose to register for this course because open source seems to be a movement that huge companies are acknowledging. I want to learn more about GitHub, Mozilla and other companies involved in this community and how to correctly release a product/project that is free and open for others to contribute to.
