## Team's Firefox Extension

### My Contributions

1. I've created a UI design so that we all know what the end goal is for the extension. [ui-image]
2. I've debugged the extension and fixed a jQuery bug I was getting after pulling from the origin/upstream's (at the time) code into my local fork. [pr-jquery-fix]
3. I've also debugged to understand why the extension itself was not running and fixed it via a [pull request].

### Status

We are currently working to get the weather of the current date, time and location of the user so that we can search Giphy for a compatible gif. Currently, our app shows a gif from the trending list. We also need to style the page according to our [UI design], add the quick links on the left hand side of the page, date on the bottom, and current weather on the right hand side of the page. I believe we can get this project done within another week.

### Git/Github Learning

I've learned the importance of forking from the main repository in order to make sure that everyone isn't working on the main copy of the project. If everyone worked on the same copy, there would be more cause for merge conflicts, I believe.
