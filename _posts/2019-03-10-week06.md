## Using OSS for Social Good or for Humanitarian Goals

I think that getting involved with 'Social Good' or HFOSS projects are great. Most of the time, they need the help and will be receptive to the help they do recieve. I think these projects can give the contributor massive practice with the technologies they've been studying and can be a great tool for them to disclose in a job interview that they contribute to open source software. Since contributing to 'Social Good' or HFOSS projects is technically contributing to your community, this can be considered volunteer work and volunteering to help others that may not have the means will look good to an employer.
